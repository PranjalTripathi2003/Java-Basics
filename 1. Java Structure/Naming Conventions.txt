Here is a list of the naming conventions in Java:

* **Packages:** Package names should be all lowercase, with words separated by dots. For example, `com.example.myapp`.
* **Classes:** Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. For example, `MyClass`.
* **Interfaces:** Interface names should be adjectives, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. For example, `MyInterface`.
* **Methods:** Method names should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. For example, `myMethod()`.
* **Variables:** Variable names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase. For example, `myVariable`.
* **Constants:** Constant names should be all uppercase, with words separated by underscores. For example, `MY_CONSTANT`.

In addition to these general naming conventions, there are a few other things to keep in mind when naming your Java code:

* Avoid using abbreviations and acronyms, unless they are well-known and widely used.
* Avoid using special characters, such as spaces, punctuation, and symbols, in your names.
* Make sure your names are descriptive and easy to understand.

By following these naming conventions, you can make your Java code more readable and maintainable.

Here are some examples of good Java naming conventions:

```java
// Package name
com.example.myapp

// Class name
MyClass

// Interface name
MyInterface

// Method name
myMethod()

// Variable name
myVariable

// Constant name
MY_CONSTANT
```

Here are some examples of bad Java naming conventions:

```java
// Package name
com.example.myApp

// Class name
myClass

// Interface name
MyIface

// Method name
my_method()

// Variable name
my_var

// Constant name
MY_CONSTANT_VALUE
```

The bad examples are more difficult to read and understand, and they are more likely to lead to errors. By following the good examples, you can write Java code that is more readable, maintainable, and error-free.
